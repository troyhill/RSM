\usage{
loadRSM(
  ncdf_address,
  variable = "ComputedHead",
  subtractTopo = TRUE,
  divideByArea = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdf_address}{address of the netCDF file}

\item{variable}{name of variable to extract from the netCDF}

\item{subtractTopo}{should topography be subtracted? i.e., should water depths (`subtractTopo = TRUE`; units = feet relative to soil surface) or stages (`subtractTopo = FALSE`; units = feet NGVD29) be returned?}

\item{divideByArea}{In development - do not use. should quantity be divided by cell area? Useful for volumetric quantities: rainfall/ET. Note that this assumes congruent units in both quantities, e.g., rainfall (ft3) / area (ft2) = rainfall (ft)}
}
\value{
a list with class `rsm` containing three elements: (1) a vector of dates in the time series, (2) data matrix (not explicitly geospatial data), (3) a cell map that links data to cells in the RSM mesh, and (4) the name of the variable extracted from the netCDF file (a metadata attribute used by other functions)
}
\description{
pulls stage data from an RSM output netCDF file
}
\examples{

\dontrun{
addr <- "G:/data/models/COP/ALTQ/globalmonitors.nc"

                variable     = 'ComputedHead',
